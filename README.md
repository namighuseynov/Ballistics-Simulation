# Unity Ballistics Simulation

## Project Description
The "Unity Ballistics Simulation" repository contains a project developed in the Unity platform, designed for creating and visualizing a ballistic system, as well as exploring the behavior of different projectiles within a virtual environment. This project provides tools and resources for modeling and simulating the motion of projectiles under different conditions and with various parameters.

## Key Features
- **Realistic Ballistics:** Develop and fine-tune a physics system that enables projectiles to behave similarly to real-world conditions. Study the effects of wind, gravity, aerodynamics, and other factors on the trajectory of flight.

- **Diverse Projectiles:** Include various types of projectiles, such as bullets, artillery shells, rockets, and others, each with unique characteristics and flight behavior.

- **User Customization:** Allow users to customize projectile parameters, initial conditions, and the surrounding environment for conducting experiments.

- **Results Visualization:** Create a visual representation of projectile trajectories, showcasing changes based on parameters and conditions.

- **Data Analysis:** Provide tools for analyzing data obtained from simulations, including graphs, statistics, and comparisons between different variations.

- **Educational Context:** Utilize the project for teaching the fundamentals of physics and ballistics through interactive simulations and experiments.
