# Unity Ballistics Simulation

## Project Description
The "Unity Ballistics Simulation" repository contains a project developed in the Unity platform, designed for creating and visualizing a ballistic system, as well as exploring the behavior of different projectiles within a virtual environment. This project provides tools and resources for modeling and simulating the motion of projectiles under different conditions and with various parameters.

## Key Features
- **Realistic Ballistics:** Develop and fine-tune a physics system that enables projectiles to behave similarly to real-world conditions. Study the effects of wind, gravity, aerodynamics, and other factors on the trajectory of flight.

- **Diverse Projectiles:** Include various types of projectiles, such as bullets, artillery shells, rockets, and others, each with unique characteristics and flight behavior.

- **User Customization:** Allow users to customize projectile parameters, initial conditions, and the surrounding environment for conducting experiments.

- **Results Visualization:** Create a visual representation of projectile trajectories, showcasing changes based on parameters and conditions.

- **Data Analysis:** Provide tools for analyzing data obtained from simulations, including graphs, statistics, and comparisons between different variations.

- **Educational Context:** Utilize the project for teaching the fundamentals of physics and ballistics through interactive simulations and experiments.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Study and customize the components of the ballistics system.
4. Add new projectiles and define their parameters.
5. Run simulations and analyze the results.
6. Edit and enhance the project to suit your needs and research.
