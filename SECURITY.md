# Security Policy for Ballistics-Simulation

## Supported Versions

This project is maintained by a single author and provided for public viewing
and non-commercial research only.  
It does **not** provide formal security support.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue, vulnerability, or misuse of the repository,

- the absence of production-level security features  

## Misuse of the Project

If you identify:

- unauthorized commercial use  
- redistribution  
- copying of assets or code  
- inclusion of the project in other simulations, games, or software  
- usage in machine learning training

please report it immediately.
